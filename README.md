Python3 solns and tests for Elements of Programming Interviews by Aziz, Lee, Prakash

This is a great book for brushing up on algorithms but since there is no python version, I thought it would be nice to code up some solutions.
I'm using the questions from the C++ version (the Java one has different numbering for questions).

## Extra Stuff:
Linter: `autopep8 --in-place --aggressive <filename>` 
`./genpy.sh filename.py` builds boilerplate.
